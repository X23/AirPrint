AirPrint
========

With thanks to Timothy J Fontaine for his script to generate the service files necessary for AirPrint.

Instructions:
<ol>
<li> First run <code> wget https://raw.github.com/X23/AirPrint/master/airprint-install.sh </code></li>

<li> Before use you need to run <code> chmod +x airprint-install.sh </code></li>

<li>Then run <code> ./airprint-install.sh </code> with the username you want to be set as a CUPS admin. 
E.g. If your username is b then run <code> ./airprint-install.sh b </code></li>
</ol>
It will be necessary to do this as root or by using sudo.

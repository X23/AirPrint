AirPrint
========

With thanks to Timothy J Fontaine for his script to generate the service files necessary for AirPrint.

Before use you need to run <code> chmod +x airprint-install.sh </code>
Then run <code> ./airprint-install.sh </code>.

It will be necessary to do this as root or by using sudo.
